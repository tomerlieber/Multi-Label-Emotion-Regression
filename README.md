# Multi-Label Emotion Regression - LSTM vs. BERT
In my last year of studies at IDC I participated in the course NLP.
In the final project me and a master's degree student designed and developed two deep learning models to predict emotions from sentences.
One model was based on [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) and another on Googleâ€™s [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)).
Then, we made a comprehensive comparison between the results and concluded interesting insights.

The project was developed in a Python development environment called Google Colab. We used a variety of libraries such as PyTorch, Pandas, Matplotlib and Hugging Face' Transformers.

I invite you to read the [final report](Multi-Label%20Emotion%20Regression%20-%20LSTM%20vs.%20BERT.pdf) that summarizes all the results.
